# Rappid Demo Application - React version

This application showcases the Rappid plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

The application logic is written using the [React][https://https://reactjs.org/] and [Typescript][https://www.typescriptlang.org/] while the Rappid is still in JS.

## Running the application

Demo requires `Node.js` and `npm`

```
npm install
npm start
```

Due to Same-Origin policy implemented in the majority of browsers to prevent content from being accessed if the file exists on another domain, it is recommended to access the application through a **Web server**. The application might work only partially when viewed from a file-system location.
